jsfxr-editor
------------

A web-based frontend to jsfxr that you can embed in your own app.

This is a cross between [as3sfxr](https://github.com/SFBTom/as3sfxr)
and Eric Fredricksen's [jsfxr](https://github.com/grumdrig/jsfxr)
frontend (not to be confused with Markus Neubrand's
[jsfxr](https://github.com/mneubrand/jsfxr) implementation which
is what we're actually using under the hood.)

This app uses bootstrap classes for style, but if you're not using
Bootstrap you're free to style as you wish.

Usage
-----
For usage instructions, see index.html & index.js.

As for prereqs, you need the following to be in the `window`
prior to use:

* Either port of jsfxr
* [ractive](http://www.ractivejs.org) (big fat dependency, soz.)
